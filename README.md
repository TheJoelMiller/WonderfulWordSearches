This is a website with a pre-made word search that can be printed in order to be solved. There is currently only one word search to be solved, but there may be a button to generate a new word search when clicked on. 

Here are the features included in my project:
*Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
*Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
*Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent *invalid input from being stored or saved).
*Analyze text and display useful information about it. (e.g. word/character count in an input field)
*Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
*Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.

To run this application:
    npm install
    npm start
